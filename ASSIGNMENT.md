# Module Documentation

The below questions should be answered (in detail!) regarding your submission.

##### 1. Reflect on how you "learned" to use the library and write the examples, c.f the "Unfamiliar APIs" reading. What is one aspect of the module's code that made is easy to understand? What is one change that would have made it easier?
> The purpose of the library was fairly straightforward, and the more common functions were easy to digest. However, the original code used some techniques like double-negation to convert to a boolean which I had to look up in order to understand. Also some fields were defined that would be used later, so reading the code multiple times was needed in order to trace the execution accurately.


##### 2. Consider the process of writing comments that "raise the level of abstraction." What does this mean to you? If you had to explain to a new CS142 student how to write an effective comment, what would you say? #####
> Good comments shouldn't just be repeating the code because if someone wanted to read the code, they would read the code. A comment that raises the level of abstration forgoes some of the nitty-gritty details in favor of getting the general idea across more clearly.


##### 3. Approximately how many hours did it take you to complete this assignment? #####
> About four hours.


##### 4. Did you receive help from any other sources (classmates, etc)? If so, please list who (be specific!). #####
> I looked on Mozilla Developer Network for a reference on regular expressions. This helped me write the example on using `find()` with regular expressions.


##### 5. Did you encounter any problems in this assignment we should warn students about in the future? How can we make the assignment better? #####
> Make sure that the module you are using works, or you might have to hunt down bugs the original author left in their code.
